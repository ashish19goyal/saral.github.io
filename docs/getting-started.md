## Getting Started with Saral

### Modelling
Start with modelling user application using [Domain driven design](https://www.domainlanguage.com/) approach. [Event Storming](https://www.eventstorming.com/) helps with this design approach. The artifcats generated from Event storming can be directly used to create a Saral app.

### Application Lifecycle
Once the application is created, developers have to manage it and continuously evolve it. Saral manages this process implicitly by providing easy to use handles as mentioned below.
