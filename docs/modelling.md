## Modelling

### Documents and diagrams
- Documentation represent the interactions and relationships between the objects of the system. 
- However, it fail to convey the conceptual definitions of system objects.
- Behaviour of the objects and the constraints on them are difficult to illustrate using documents and diagrams. 
- More often than not, these documents are just interaction diagrams representing the skeletons of the ideas.
- As the system evolves, these documents lose their connection with the flow of the system becoming stale or irrelevant.
- On the other hand, comprehensive diagrams of the entire object model overwhelm the reader with details. Again failing to communicate effectively.

### Unified modelling language
- A modelling language should be able to clearly communicate the meaning of the concepts it represents.
- Documentation should be implicit to the modelling language. Not an after thought.
- Declarative style language to make it easier for the developers to comprehend its meaning.
- One model should underlie implementation, design and team communication.

### Visualization
- A single visualization format doesn't work for all types of communications or all types of projects.
- Developers should be able to visualize the system using different visualization formats. e.g. Component diagrams, Entity Relationship diagrams, Sequence diagrams etc.
