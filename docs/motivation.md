# Why do we need this plugin?
When a developer is building an application, he should be choosing the best tools available. However, mostly the developer is bound to choose the tools he best knows how to use. Although the application is built and delivered successfully, the developer could never go back to see if the results could have been better had he chosen a different tool. 

The objective of this plugin is to take the tools out of the equation. With the help of this plugin, a developer should be able to build an application in any of the desired technologies. They can compare the results and choose to deliver the one that works best.

## The process
1. Plan and design
2. Implementation
3. Testing
4. Optimize
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring

This plugin will help the developer by taking care of point 2 (implementation) and 3 (testing). So that they can spend more of their energies on 1, 4, 5 and 6 

## The counter argument
Choosing the best technologies will still be difficult even if a developer has the same application implemented in multiple technologies. As the performance also includes maintainability aspects.

## The rebuttal
This limitation can be overcome by running pre-production, UAT, operational tests with different technologies. This plugin is not a complete solution in itself to solve the big problem. However, it is a move in the direction to nirvana for the developer community.
