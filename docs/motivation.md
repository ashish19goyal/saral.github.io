## Motivation
When developers are building an application, they should be choosing the best available tools. However, mostly the developers are bound to choose the tools they best know how to use. Although the application is built and delivered successfully, they could never go back to see if the results could have been better had they chosen a different set of tools. 

Our objective is to take the tools out of the equation. Saral helps developers to be able to build an application in any of the desired technologies. They can compare the results and choose to deliver the one that works best.

## SDLC process
1. Plan and design
2. Implementation
3. Testing
4. Optimization
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring
7. User Trials

Saral helps the developer by taking care of point 2 to pint 6. So that they can spend more of their energies on 1 and 6, i.e., design and user trials.

## User stories
I am a part time carpenter. When I started carpentry in 2019, I did not know anything about it. It was a curiosity that got me started. Slowly I figured out the tools - the measuring tape, the axe, the grinder, the drill, the hammer and so on. Then I experimented with the raw material - wooden logs, wooden board, plywood, mdf board, cardboard etc. It was easier to use one over the other. Learning to work with all of these took some time. Starting from the raw materials, it took me 4 months to make the first piece of furniture. While building it, I got some minor injuries as well and discovered the importance of safety equipment.

My brother-in-law took a different approach to his curiosity in carpentry. He joined a bootcamp who taught him to create a chair from pre-fabricated pieces. They directly provided him the right set of tools that he needed to build that chair. He could build the chair within a week, without any injuries.

Both of us learned the basics of carpentry and built something utilitarian.

I was living with my dentist brother in Gurgaon in 2015. He had just opened his clinic. He asked me to setup a website for the clinic. The main objective of the website was to enable online appointments booking. It took 2-3 weeks to setup the website. As the clinic grew, we needed to add more content to the website about all the dental services provided here. We also wanted to publish about the special dental cases on a regular basis in the form of a blog. This would consume a lot of my time. Since I was busy with my regular job, the modifications got delayed and a backlog got created.

Then my brother discovered WIX. He built a new website as per his desire within hours using WIX. He can now publish new content to the website whenever he wants. He had complete domain knowledge. He became a citizen developer.
