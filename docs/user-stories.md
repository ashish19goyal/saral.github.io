## The carpenter
I am a part time carpenter. When I started carpentry in 2019, I did not know anything about it. It was a curiosity that got me started. Slowly I figured out the tools - the measuring tape, the axe, the grinder, the drill, the hammer and so on. Then I experimented with the raw material - wooden logs, wooden board, plywood, mdf board, cardboard etc. It was easier to use one over the other. Learning to work with all of these took some time. Starting from the raw materials, it took me 4 months to make the first piece of furniture. While building it, I got some minor injuries as well and discovered the
importance of safety equipment.

My brother-in-law took a different approach to his curiosity in carpentry. He joined a bootcamp who taught him to create a chair from pre-fabricated pieces. They taught him to use the tools that he needed to build that chair. He could build the chair within a week, without any injuries.

Both of us learned the basics of carpentry and built something utilitarian.


## The dental clinic
I was living with my dentist brother in Gurgaon in 2015. He had just opened his clinic. He asked me to setup a website for the clinic. The main objective of the website was to enable online appointments booking. It took 2-3 weeks to setup the website. As the clinic grew, we needed to add more content to the website about all the dental services provided here. We also wanted to publish about the special dental cases on a regular basis in the form of a blog. This would consume a lot of my time. Since I was busy with my regular job, the modifications got delayed and a backlog got created.

Then my brother discovered WIX. He built a new website as per his desire within hours using WIX. He can now publish new content to the website whenever he wants. He doesn’t need any help from a software developer to do so. He is a citizen developer.

## The demo
I was working with Oracle in Bangalore as a software developer in 2021. We were building a data-integration service on the cloud. We had product demos every two weeks. In the demo, there would usually be two types of presenters, one who knew technology and nothing about the product, second who knew the product but nothing about technology. Whenever they would discuss the application of ML in performance optimization of RedBull racing team in F1, I would get lost in thoughts and get back to consciousness only after it was over. It was a great productivity loss. It was perhaps not only me, but many others like me.

I would always ask myself, why am I attending these sessions? They have the domain expertise, why are they taking so much pain to explain it to me? Why are they not self-sufficient?
